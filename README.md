## Change App name
Default name is 'boilerplate' and if you open your project on Xcode or Android Studio this is how you see its name, to change it follow the next steps:
- First make a copy of the react-native-boilerplate directory. And go to your newly cloned directory.
- Change the app name at index.ios.js and index.android.js files which is given as a parameter to AppRegistry.
```js
// Change this line
change AppRegistry.registerComponent('boilerplate', () => App);

// To this
AppRegistry.registerComponent('your-desire-app-name', () => App);
```
- Change the name and version accordingly on cloned-directory/package.json
```js
// Change this
{
  "name": "boilerplate",
  "displayName": "boilerplate"
}

// To this
{
  "name": "your-desire-app-name",
  "displayName": "your-desire-app-name"
}
```
- Delete /ios and /android folders which are remaining from your older app.
- To generate /ios and /android folders again run.
```sh
react-native upgrade
```
- For any native dependency run.
```sh
react-native link
```
- Finally run react-native run-ios or anything you want.
